            <h1> Brazilian congresspeople and their expensive banquets            </h1>
            <p>Brazilian congresspeople are famous for spending money on <a href="https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/politica-brasil/sem-limite-de-gastos-congresso-reembolsa-despesas-de-parlamentares-com-ostras-e-camarao-trufado">fancy</a> food and restaurants. </p>

<p>They have the right to use a certain amount of public funds every year for mandate expenses, including food. Congress 
rules <a href="https://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/int/atomes/2009/atodamesa-43-21-maio-2009-588364-norma-cd-mesa.html">declare</a> that this money, known as “cota parlamentar”, should be used to pay for congresspeople’s own meals.</p>

<p>But many more people might be filling their bellies with those funds.</p>

<p>An analysis made using open data shows that dozens of meals have been paid by congresspeople who took office in 2019 on the same day and receipt. Some representatives have spent over R$ 3,000 in just one meal (US$ 565) with over 30 plates. </p>

<p> Public data can show how much money was spent and sometimes even the restaurant where they’ve eaten, but not what was the food neither who were with them. The Congress rules don’t 
require representatives to justify these expenses. </p>

<p> The data source can be found <a href="https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/swagger/api.html#staticfile">here</a>. Check the code on <a href="https://github.com/luizftoledo/luizftoledo.github.io/tree/main/congress-expenses-with-food">Github.</a><p>

<p>First let's take a look on how much federal deputies spent in 2019, 2020 and 2021,
 after there were elected, individually. This is the sum of all their receipts. 
I chose to analyze the data from different years together because 2020 and 2021
 were very atypical years due to 
 the pandemic and 
 the <a href="https://www.poder360.com.br/congresso/camara-so-volta-ao-trabalho-presencial-em-marco-apos-carnaval/">home office policy</a> 
 in the Congress.</p>
