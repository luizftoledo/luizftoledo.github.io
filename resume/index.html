      <p><strong>CROSS BORDER AND INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM</strong</p>
      <p><strong>OCCRP - Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project | Reporter | São Paulo (Dec. 2020 - Aug.
      2021)</strong></p>
      <p>Responsible for reporting in English and Portuguese on cross-border crime and corruption related to Brazil
      figures and developing partnerships with international and local media. I served as their first Brazilian reporter. We
      have partnered with 17 media organizations, including Miami Herald and Le Monde, to publish Open Lux, a
      project about tax evasion in Luxembourg. Our Brazilian story contributed to current investigations into corruption
      in Brazil. I have also partnered with The Intercept to report on a story about environmental crimes involving a
      Canadian giant company and in another project about Chinese tobacco growth in Brazil.
      DATA JOURNALISM
      CNN Brasil | Investigative producer/data journalist | São Paulo (Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2020) | Responsible for
      reporting on investigative stories about Covid-19 and other national themes for broadcast and online news.
      Nominated for Sigma Awards after reporting on how the Brazilian government imported chloroquine ingredients to
      help pharmaceutical tycoons who supported the president. The story was used by the prosecutors to open an
      investigation. I was also responsible for producing a broadcast story about illegal air charters that were operated
      using federal public funds. Flight operators highlighted in this investigation were fined and sanctioned because of
      the story findings.
      TV Globo | Data Journalist | São Paulo (Jan. 2019 - Dec. 2019) | Brazil's largest TV channel. Responsible for
      producing local broadcast and online stories by finding, analyzing and cleaning data through Freedom of
      information requests (FOIA), spreadsheets and big-data analysis (SQL). Also responsible for providing data to
      other journalists in the newsroom.
      DAILY / BREAKING NEWS
      Estadão | Public Policy reporter and Data Journalist | São Paulo (Sep. 2013 - Dec. 2018) | Major national
      newspaper. I have worked as a daily news reporter for the first four years, in the Metro section, writing about
      public policies in the city and state government. I have exposed that the result of a millionaire public bid was
      decided many days before the companies would compete for it. I have also exposed that high level officials were
      deliberately hiding documents and data from journalists to avoid public shaming. In my last year I moved to a data
      journalism team, providing data and documents to other journalists and reporting on national elections. I have
      revealed how a small company created the largest Facebook disinformation network in favor of the
      then-presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. Facebook decided to remove all their pages after my story was
      published.
